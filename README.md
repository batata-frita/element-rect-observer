## Known issues

- The spec for ResizeObserver has a known limitation that will cause the ResizeObserver to throw a `ResizeObserver loop limit exceeded` exception. This is not a problem, since nothing is actually broken, itâ€™s just a consequence of the spec. You can find more details in a [discussion thread from the spec repo](https://github.com/WICG/ResizeObserver/issues/38#issuecomment-334816361)
